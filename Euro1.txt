Harry Kane sent England into uncharted waters on Wednesday when he scored to propel England past Denmark into the Euro 2020 final. His effort from the rebound off his initially saved penalty in extra time to send his country into their first ever European Championship final. It was also England's first ever major tournament final after the 1966 World Cup final. Kane tied Gary Lineker's record for the most combined England goals at European Championships and World Cups, but his extra time winner against Denmark came with huge controversy. It was Raheem Sterling who initially won the penalty which sparked the controversy. Sterling dashed through Denmark's defence in the first half of extra time, twisting past a couple of defenders. However, he appeared to go down under a challenge from Joakim Maehle and the referee promptly pointed to the penalty spot. VAR, understandably, had a look at the incident and upheld the decision much to the furore of the Danish defenders. Kane promptly stepped up for the spot kick but had to convert the rebund after Kasper Schmeichel saved his initial effort. Though Sterling has after the match claimed that he felt a contact, the replays showed if there was one, it was extremely minimal. The Manchester City forward appeared to be falling down even before Maehle had tried to challenge him. Surprisingly, VAR did not ask the referee to come and look at the monitor to make his mind up and that caused considerable confusion among fans and pundits alike. Many leading experts, including former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and current AS Roma boss Jose Mourinho have stated that it was not a penalty at all while numerous fans stated that Sterling dived. Understandably, the incident also gave rise to trolls.
